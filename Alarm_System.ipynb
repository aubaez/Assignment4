    "My workflow throughout the assignment goes as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "I first broke up the assignment into smaller functional areas (connecting the buzzer, generating a tone, button input, the server process, client process, and running 2 processes).  Since I do not have another PYNQ board to connect to, I had to think of a creative way to simulate the 2 processes on another board.  Once I got the buzzer working, I created an async function to set up and test the buzzer and connection requirements with the press of different buttons.  Once I got that working, I completed my server process and client process.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second PYNQ board simulation, I decided to run server/client code on my local machine and connect to the 2 processes running on the PYNQ board by using different Ports. (I am connected via ethernet)  I used Port 12345 for 1 set of client/server and 65432 for the other set of client/server.  To simulate button input from my local machine, I decided to send messages to the PYNQ board and have the Server code decode the message.  If I sent the message \"Disconnecting\" from my local machine, the PYNQ board would also disconnect.  When I sent the message \"Turning on Alarm\" this would indicate the PYNQ board to set the buzzer off.\n",
    "\n",
    "An issue I came across was using the async function for button input.  I realized the processes were not sharing variables and it became a hassle to set flags for the client and server processes to read.  I realized later that I could directly check for button input within my server/client code and did not need the async function.  On the bright side, the button input function had helped me test my different functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test my overall design, I tested one processes at a time.  This helped me debug the code on my local machine and get the correct communication betweent the PYNQ board and my simulated PYNQ board.  "
